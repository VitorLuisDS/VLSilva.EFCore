# VLSilva.EFCore

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/plcvDhF.png">

VLSilva.EFCore is a aggregate of projects containing useful resources when working with EFCore.

## Why did I create it?
The projects were created to fasten EFCore implementation since I always created the same resources in every project I worked in.
